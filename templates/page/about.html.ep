<div class="about body">
  <p>Post::Text is a <a href="">textboard</a> a bit like 2channel. You
    can post whatever you want anonymously just please mind the
    <%= link_to rules => 'rules_page' %>. Markdown is supported for
    formatting posts using the
    <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">
      original implementation from The Daring Fireball</a>. For
    example, back-ticks are for <em>inline code</em> while
    indentation should be used if you want an entire code bock:</p>
  <pre><code>
This is `inline_code()` and so is ```this()```. This is incorrect:

```
if (true) {
    do_stuff();
}
```

This is correct for a multi-line code block:

    if (true) {
        do_stuff();
    }

You can use an actual tab character or four spaces to indent.
  </code></pre>
  <p>There is a button for users to 'flag' a post for review by a
    moderator. If you need further assistance you can reach out to the
    <a href="mailto:swaggboi@slackware.uk">webmaster</a>. There is
    also a 'bump' button you're free to use and abuse to your heart's
    content. If you're already using a feed reader or some sort of
    email client you can check out the
    <%= link_to 'RSS feed', threads_feed => {format => 'rss'} %>.</p>
