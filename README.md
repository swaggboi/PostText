## TODOs

1. Form to create new remarks
1. I'm kinda hardcoding the single-thread view `link_to` in the
   templates because I cannot for the life of me figure out how to use
   `url_for` to populate the `thread_id` placeholder. Probably need to
   clean-up the HTML too, just used `<span>` cuz I didn't know what
   else to use
1. Just clean stuff up in general lol
