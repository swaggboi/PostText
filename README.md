# Post::Text

A textboard written in Perl

## Installing locally

Install dependencies:

    cpanm --installdeps .

## Running locally

Create a config file:

    cp example_post_text.conf post_text.conf

This file right now just contains a Perl hash reference. Someday it
should be YAML or XML or something better suited.

Run it in development mode:

    morbo -w public/ -w lib/ -w templates/ -w script/ script/post_text

Now try requesting http://localhost:3000

## Testing

First, create a valid first thread and first remark to the first
thread. The tests rely on the existence of thread #1 and remark #1
being the first remark to that first thread. Then you can run the
tests locally:

    prove -l

## TODOs

1. Re-visit this TODO list because it doesn't seem like I'm gunna
   bother with all new posts flagged mode lmao. There's a CAPTCHA now
   so it's not as painfully open...
1. Automate the holiday backgrounds with JS
1. Test JS with LibreJS or something like that (I don't like RMS I
   just want free JS!!)
1. "All new posts flagged" mode (require approval for new posts)
1. Tests for mod-only user?

## Crazy future ideas

### (Lord knows there's TODOs I could be working on...)

1. Is `remark_tally` counting hidden remarks? Tried to add a `WHERE
   NOT hidden_status` but that returns null, probably need a different
   `JOIN` which may not be worth the trouble/processing
1. Implement tripcodes (moving this down in priority due to complexity...)
1. Post thread via SMS (twil.io??)
